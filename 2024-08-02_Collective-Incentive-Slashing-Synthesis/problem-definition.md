# Problem definition
At its core, the problem arises from the inherent challenge of managing interdependent systems where more than two individual components interact without full visibility or accountability.

This issue comes from two fundamental aspects:
Information Asymmetry: Each participant in the system has access to only a partial view of the entire operation. This limited perspective hinders the ability to accurately diagnose problems, assess performance, or identify the root causes of failures. When a system operates with incomplete or asymmetric information, errors or failures become difficult to trace back to their true origin. This, in turn, leads to the risk of misattributing blame or failing to recognize patterns of behavior that may undermine the system's integrity.

Interdependence of Components: In decentralized systems, the performance and success of the overall system depend on the coordinated efforts of multiple independent actors. Each actor's behavior and decisions can impact others, creating a complex web of dependencies. When a failure occurs, it is often the result of a breakdown in this coordination, rather than the fault of a single actor. However, without clear lines of responsibility, it becomes challenging to determine how to address and correct such failures in a way that is perceived as fair by all involved.

These issues create a fundamental problem in ensuring reliability and fairness in decentralized systems, where traditional methods of oversight, accountability, and enforcement are not feasible. The challenge lies in designing mechanisms that can effectively manage this uncertainty, align incentives, and promote cooperative behavior, even when individual actions cannot be fully observed or controlled.
